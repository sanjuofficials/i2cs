##Quick Start with Ionic Starter
###A guide to quickly set up and running the i2CSMobile app with ionic starter package

This guide will explain you how to setup the app quickly using an ionic starter template. In a starter template we provide content of `www` folder, and all the additional dependencies should be installed by running few commands. Extract the content of the downloaded zip file. The package contains two folders for `ionic` app and `opencart` module. Open your CMD or terminal and navigate to the place where you would like your project to be initialized (Ex. `C:\projects\`).
```
